# REST-micro-brews
A website built with Flask that tells you all of the nearby micro-brewerys in a given city using the Open Brewery DB. 

I will need to come back to this project to complete it, but at this point the user is able to create an account and search for brewerys. 

TODOs:
  1. add page for user reviews
  2. error handling for cities without results
  3. save user reviews to DB
  4. add 'get directions' to the results cards
